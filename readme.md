### Basic Scraping on flipkart using selenium

The script, `Flipkart_selenium_laptopprices.py`, navigates to the Flipkart website and searches for laptops using a predefined search query. It then scrapes the laptop names, ratings, and prices from the search results page and saves the data to a CSV file.

The script includes error handling to handle cases where the search query does not return any results or if the Selenium driver encounters an error. The repository also includes a sample CSV file containing scraped laptop data for reference.
